ANOVA Report on weight loss diets using R

Given a data set of a random sample of 76 individuals who are categorised in 3 diets, (Diet A, Diet B and Diet C).
The in depth analysis of what the Diet A, B or C consists of is not given to us to prevent any implicit bias that may occur due to excess redundant information that does not change the outcome of our variance analysis.
But we are given the goal of these diets, which is to analyse the best suitable one for weight loss. 
The approach chosen to show model the data, is through the single factor ANOVA (analysis of variance of the given linear data).
The dataset is called. "loseit.csv" and we would use the values obtained in this dataset to come to a conlusion on the best diet for weight loss.
